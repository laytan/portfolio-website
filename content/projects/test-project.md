## Technologies used

I used Gridsome as a static site generator with Vue and SCSS.  
Although i did have some experience using Vue before this, Gridsome was totally new to me.

## Challenges

Gridsome was a challenge because it was also my first static site.  
It did look alot like regular Vue but you had some subtle differences and nuances.

Gridsome uses GraphQL to get pages content into Vue and i had no experience with GraphQL to.

I think i did quite well for myself because it is effortless to upload a new project and all my Github Repos get loaded automatically so i can focus on writing posts like these for the big ones.
